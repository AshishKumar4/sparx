"""Rejects low-evidence Python: the rules a type checker and ruff cannot state.

Ported in spirit from dmmulroy/anti-slop, which rejects TypeScript that claims
less than the author knew: `unknown` in a contract, an open dictionary, a type
assertion with no invariant behind it, `typeof` narrowing instead of parsing at
the boundary, a symbol named for its shape, a mocked module instead of a seam.
Python's version of each is below. No dependency, one output format,
`path:line:col: SLOPxxx message`, exit 1 on any finding.

Scope is per rule, because the rules are not all about the same thing:

- `src/dew` is the published contract, so every rule runs there. A plugin
  package checks itself with `--root` (its checkout) and `--package` (its
  name, so `src/<package>` is the contract and its own modules are the ones
  SLOP008 will not see patched).
- `tests`, `tools`, `recipes` and `examples` are scripts and proofs. Their
  names and annotations are local, so the contract rules (SLOP001, SLOP002,
  SLOP004, SLOP005) do not run there. A swallowed exception, a narration
  comment and an unsplittable function are defects anywhere, so those do.
- SLOP008 is about the suite only.
- SLOP010 is about the contract's consumers of its models, so it runs in
  `src/<package>`, against an index of the whole package.

Every rule fails the gate, and none has a per-finding suppression.

Analysis boundaries, stated the way anti-slop states its own: this reads one
file's AST, with no imported definitions and no inference across calls, but
for SLOP010, which reads the whole package's imports, re-exports, aliases and
class bases, and Flax's Module from its installed source (never importing
it), to know which classes are models. It sees what Python spells, not what
dynamic dispatch reaches; behaviour across models is the capability matrix's
proof (tests/test_capability_matrix.py).
SLOP004's isinstance half fires only when the annotation it needs is written in
the same scope; a value whose type arrives from another module is not narrowed
by this checker and is not reported. SLOP006 walks the handler body it can see,
so an exception handed to a function that re-raises elsewhere reads as reported.
